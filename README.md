Personal portfolio site: a statically prerendered [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) frontend built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), served from a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that also proxies the GitHub API behind an edge cache.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. 📦 Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. 🏃 Run the development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Runs `wrangler dev`, serving the worker and the built assets together at [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787). This is the realistic target — the API routes only exist in the worker.

For frontend-only work, `bun run dev:vite` starts the plain Vite server, but `/api/*` requests will 404.

Live GitHub data needs a token. Create a `.dev.vars` file (gitignored) with:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

A fine-grained token with no extra scopes is enough; the site reads only public profile and contribution data.

### 3. 🏗️ Build for production

```bash
bun run build:prod
```

Output lands in `dist/`, with `/`, `/about`, `/contact` and `/404` prerendered to static HTML.

### 4. 👀 Preview the production build

```bash
bun run preview
```

## ⚙️ Scripts

| Purpose                  | Command                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 🚀 Start dev server      | `bun run dev`           |
| 🎨 Frontend-only dev     | `bun run dev:vite`      |
| 🏗️ Build for production  | `bun run build:prod`    |
| 👀 Preview build         | `bun run preview`       |
| 🧪 Run tests             | `bun run test`          |
| 📊 Test coverage         | `bun run test:coverage` |
| 🔒 Typecheck             | `bun run typecheck`     |
| 🧹 Lint code             | `bun run lint`          |
| ✨ Format & fix          | `bun run format:fix`    |
| ✅ Full pre-commit check | `bun run check`         |
| ☁️ Deploy                | `bun run deploy`        |

`bun run check` runs typecheck, lint, tests and a production build — the same gate CI enforces.
