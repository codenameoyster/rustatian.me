# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Personal portfolio site for rustatian.me. Statically prerendered Preact frontend served by a Cloudflare Worker that also proxies the GitHub API. There is no blog and no CMS — all page content is hardcoded in `src/data/profile.ts`.

## Commands

Bun-first: `bun.lock` is the committed lockfile and CI runs Bun. Use `bun run <script>`, never npm. See `package.json` for the full list; the ones that aren't guessable:

- `bun run dev` is `wrangler dev` on **:8787**, serving worker + assets together. `bun run dev:vite` is frontend-only and its `/api/*` routes 404.
- `bun run check` (typecheck + lint + test + prod build) is the gate CI enforces — run it before calling work done.

Lint and format are **Biome**. There is no ESLint or Prettier despite what muscle memory suggests.

## Architecture

`src/worker.ts` is the production entrypoint and the backend: asset serving, SPA/404 fallback, security headers, CSP, and a GitHub API proxy behind an edge cache with per-IP rate limiting. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a Workers secret; locally it lives in `.dev.vars`, which is gitignored and must never be committed.

Load-bearing constraints, none of which the code will teach you on its own:

- **Every upstream route must project its response** (`src/worker/user.ts`, `src/worker/contributions.ts`). Upstream requests carry the site's token, so returning a body verbatim leaks fields GitHub only sends to the account owner. The `UpstreamRoute` type enforces this — don't work around it.
- **The route list lives in three places that must stay in sync**: `src/components/AppRoutes/AppRoutes.tsx`, the prerender list in `vite.config.ts`, and `public/sitemap.xml`. Missing the vite entry ships a page with no prerendered HTML and no per-route meta, and nothing fails.
- **The inline theme script in `index.html` is CSP-allowed by a sha256 hash** pinned as `THEME_BOOTSTRAP_HASH` in `src/worker.ts`. Editing that script — whitespace included — invalidates the hash and theme resolution silently stops. Recompute both together.
- **Design tokens are `--s-*` / `--r-*` / `--fs-*` / `--fg-*` / `--bg-*` / `--bd-*`** (see `src/styles/tokens.css`). An invented token name produces a declaration the browser silently drops, so the styling just goes missing rather than erroring.

Prefer the `@/` path alias; the codebase uses it almost exclusively.

## Testing

Vitest with jsdom. When touching the worker's caching, note that the mock cache is a plain `Map` with no expiry — it cannot catch TTL or eviction behavior, so assert on stored headers rather than trusting time-based tests.

## Conventions

- Components are plain arrow functions with a local props interface. No `FunctionalComponent`, no `React.FC`.
- Hooks come from `preact/hooks`.
- Page `<head>` content goes through `src/components/Seo/Seo.tsx`, not a bare `<Helmet>` — it supplies canonical and Open Graph tags consistently.
